        <h2>Sentimental Human, Sentimental Human Knowledge</h2>
        <p>This project focuses on the subject of information revisions on English Wikipedia page,
          which is undoubtedly one of the richest, most active free online encyclopedias. </br>
        <br></br>
        Its narrative unpacks Wikipedia’s gigantic digital storage and reveals the human touch of it,
        not only because when each Wikipedian edits the data, they potentially leave their own sentiments
        and bias but also because of the collective construction of a virtual community where editors
        collaborate, argue, or gain a global reputation by their contribution to Wikipedia.
          <!-- “Though avocado only entered the Chinese market several years ago,
          its imports have been soaring…it eventually won the hearts of middle-class
          foodies as it is rich in nutrition”. The uprising of avocados in Chinese market has
          been a miracle. The demand of avocados by young middle-class has increased roughly 1000
          times more. -->

  <p style="font-size: 20px;">With its medium as an interactive webpage,
    this project intends to build a narrative that starts from the macro
    perspective and arrives at the micro. It first maps out English Wikipedia as an
    international enormous project through the total number of revisions and most active
    editors by country, then it dives into specific content including most edited pages
    and what has been changed on a certain page.
  <br></br>
  <p>Thus, my project intends to tell a story of Wikipedia edit history,
    dissecting one of the world’s biggest data storage and retracing the voice of
    individual contributors. I have four datasets which are collected, analyzed and
    published openly by Wikimedia Foundation, they are respectively:
    <br><br>
 <li>The number of daily total edits from April 2011 to March 2021
   <br>
(e.g. 2011-04-28 | 163106 edits)</li>
 <li>Active editors by country from 2018 to 2021
   <br>
	(e.g. US | 26010 editors | 2018)</li>
 <li>Most edited 100 pages every month from 2011 to 2021
   <br>
	(e.g. page “Osama bin Laden” | 1542 edits | rank 23 | 2011-5 )</li>
<li>Detailed revision history of article “World War II” from Dec 2018 to April 2021
  <br>
(e.g. user name, timestamp, a short comment why he/she made the change)</li>
<br><br>
</p>
<p>

    Either it is biased information or purposeful interruption, the nature of individual
    contribution has defined the digital project of Wikipedia with a sense of human touch.
    It is simply not possible to avoid irrational behavior or limitation that both originates
    from individuals or the society.
