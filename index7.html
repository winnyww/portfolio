            <h3>Mirroring Loss <br>- One Year in One Minute </h3>
            <p1>This project creates a one-person experience to contextualize our loss during
              the Covid-19 pandemic by referring the loss of lives to the vanishment of self-reflection
              in the mirror.
            <br><br> It is created in the background of a year that caught us unprepared.
            This project encourages people to pause their anxiety and reminds them that the year
            of 2020 essentially signifies the sudden loss of millions of lives.

  <p>As of today, it’s been more than 17 months since coronavirus was officially recognized in China.
    In the past year, prejudices, hatred and chaos have dominated a lot of people’s mentality.
    Even more people were hurt when a sense of tension and discrimination is growing in our society.
    Mirroring Loss is created in this background, with a purpose to encourage people pause their anxiety
    and remind them the year of 2022 essentially signifies the sudden loss of millions of lives.
    <br></br>
    The main interface is a smart mirror --constructed by a large screen monitor and Kinect motion sensor
    -- it will detect the user’s body and show a reflection of it in generative particle arts. The number
    of particles are in ratio to a large population. The user can come in front of the mirror and see themselves
    in a virtual space. With sound as an indication, a meditative experience will start: coincided with the
    death number throughout the year, particles that construct the human body will gradually fall down, accumulated
    on the groud,
    representing the vanishing of life. In this process, the user will witness the transformation of his or
    her body towards incompleteness, fragmentation and decay. It is a symbolic reminder that the loss of human
    lives is the loss of our own community.

  <p>Project Mirroring Loss aims to challenge the problematic prejudices and their dominance on mentality
     during the ongoing global crisis by designing a meaningful self-reflection experience.
     The memories for 2020 are full of chaos: contagious disease, shutdown of schools and shops,
     people losing jobs, etc. We are sometimes buried in such chaos, the distress and anger, while
     forgetting that the year 2020 signifies the sudden loss of lives, those who could have more time. <br><br>
     Mirroring Loss is designed to help its users pause their anxious thoughts and contextualize loss,
     to reclaim empathy for one another. Like a pillar supporting society, empathy is the foundation
     of bonding, networking, and community-forming. A reminder of being empathic is significant for
     everyone to recreate the social closeness and to defeat this pandemic as a whole.  </p>
